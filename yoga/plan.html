        Yoga is about self relfection
      </h3>
      <p>
        Whether it is stress, depression, or any other mental health needs Yoga has your back. 
       Yoga has been commercialized as a get-fit practice. But I believe we are missing the most vital element when we focus on what we can lose. You will see Yoga is not about what we can lose, it is about what we can gain. The commercialized concept of Yoga is too shallow whether it is getting super skinny, or flexibility, and we can not forget balance am I, right? However, the biggest unmentioned benefit of Yoga is its ability to develop your inner awareness, so you can know yourself on a deeper level. The process of doing this will help you to come to know the different thought loops you are stuck in as well as solve said thought loops. We all struggle with this, but those with mental health challenges are especially susceptible. Stopping these thought loops helps you to calm down and find that peace again that you were missing.

      <h3>
        Love of Yoga, Love of self
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Now that we have laid out the why behind yoga and mental health, I would like to talk about how we go about this process.  I walk you through a program that is not designed to make you fit, though many of the students tend to find they slip a few notches on their belts anyway. The goal of the program is to fall in love with yourself. Like a child on Christmas seeing their presents for the first time. If you can not walk out of my class after this program and not say you really truly love yourself then I have done you a disservice and will promptly refund you in full.  I promise that I will teach you to wake up and feel so giddy about what you are seeing in the mirror that you wont need anything else to get you up and going in the day.

      <h3>Practices</h3>
      <p>
        The how behind Yoga health: Yoga health focuses on many ancient practices to unlock your inner child. As children, we deal with a lot of new life experiences and are not sure how to deal with these issues so we stuff them down and do not properly feel these negative emotions. That is why it is important to bring all these things to the surface. After bringing all these things up and acknowledging them the next step is to feel them truly feel these emotions and then we let go. This is all a part of the grief process and is some of the reasoning behind our western societies mental health epidemic.
